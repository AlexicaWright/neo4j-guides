== Convert of Asciidoc Files to Neo4j Browser Guides

It uses AsciiDoctor erb templates to generate the outline html and then for each level-2 header a slide.

=== Create HTML

----
./run.sh path/to/a_guide.adoc [guide.html]

-> html/a_guide.html
----

=== Start Local Server

It is patched to allow CORS headers for the browser, to serve the html directory.

----
python http.py &
----

You have to edit `conf/neo4j-server.properties` (for enterprise) to set `dbms.browser.remote_content_hostname_whitelist=*` and restart.
You can also add the specific `localhost:8001` address. 
For neo4j-community you have to run the http script on port 80.

In the browser then run

----
:play http://localhost:8001/html/a_guide.html
----

You can find more details on how to create guides and their format in link:docs/remote-guides.md[] and an example in link:docs/remote.html[]
